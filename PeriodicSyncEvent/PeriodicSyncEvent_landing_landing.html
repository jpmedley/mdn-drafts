<p class="summary">The <code>PeriodicSyncEvent</code> interface of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Periodic_Background_Synchronization_APIs">Web Periodic Background Synchronization API</a>provides a way to run tasks in the service worker with network connectivity. An instance of this event is passed to the {{domxref('ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.onperiodicsync')}} handler. This happens periodically, at an interval greater than or equal to that set in {{domxref('PeriodicSyncManager.register()')}}. Other implementation-specific factors such as the user's engagement with the site decide the actual interval.</p>

<h2>Web Periodic Background Synchronization Concepts and Usage</h2>

<p>In this section, describe the API's purpose and usage cases in a bit more detail â€” why was a need recognized for it? What problems does it solve? What concepts does it involve? How do you use it, from a high level perspective?</p>

<p>Don't go into a lot of detail in this section, and don't include code examples. If there are a lot of concepts to explain to explain around this API, you should explain them in a separate "Concepts..." article (e.g. <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API/Concepts">WebVR concepts</a>). For a practical usage guide with code examples, you should include a "Usage..." article in your API docs (e.g. <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API/Using_the_WebVR_API">Using the WebVR API</a>).</p>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Fill in a simple example that nicely shows a typical usage of the API, then perhaps some more complex examples (see our guide on how to add <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Structures/Code_examples">code examples</a> for more information).</p>

<p>This text should be replaced with a brief description of what the example demonstrates.</p>

<p>If you've included an example directly in the page as shown above, and that example is longer than 4-5 lines or so, consider following the example with a step-by-step explanation of what it's doing, so that new programmers can learn more easily, and to help smooth the learning curve for complicated subjects.</p>
